# <Project Name>

One-line summary.

## Always Read

These files apply to every task. Read them first:
1. `rules/project-rules.md`
2. `rules/coding-standards.md`

Keep this list to 2–3 files max. Domain-specific rules do NOT go here.

## Common Tasks

Each task entry lists the exact files to read — don't read files not listed for your task:

- Add feature X → read `rules/<domain>-rules.md` + follow `workflows/<task>.md`
- Add feature Y → read `rules/<domain>-rules.md` + follow `workflows/<task>.md`; ref: `references/<topic>.md`
- Fix bug → read task-relevant `rules/*.md` + follow `workflows/fix-bug.md`; ref: `references/gotchas.md`
- **Other / unlisted task** → read `rules/project-rules.md` + `rules/coding-standards.md` (Already Read above), then match by workflow filename (verb-noun convention: `add-page.md`, `fix-bug.md`, etc.). If no filename matches, proceed with just the Always Read rules.

## Known Gotchas

Brief, scannable list of the most costly pitfalls. Full details in `references/gotchas.md`.

- Gotcha 1: one-line summary → see `references/gotchas.md#section`
- Gotcha 2: one-line summary → see `references/<topic>.md#section`

## Rule Priority
1. `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. `skills/<name>/rules/`
3. `skills/<name>/workflows/`
4. `skills/<name>/references/`
5. Root `README.md`
6. `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` / `.claude/` (compatibility only)

## Project Boundaries

### Description as Trigger Condition

The `description` field in frontmatter is **not** a passive summary — it is what the Agent uses at runtime to decide whether to activate the skill. It should answer "is this request in this skill's domain?", not "which workflow should run?" A vague description means the skill silently never fires; an overstuffed description becomes a brittle keyword list that competes with `SKILL.md` routing.

**Bad** (too vague — Agent can't match it):
```yaml
description: Helps with API testing
```

**Good** (domain / intent-cluster phrases + activation conditions):
```yaml
description: >
  This skill should be used when the user asks to work on this repository, such as
  "这个接口报错了", "这里返回不对", "测试挂了", "fix this failing test",
  or "debug this error".
  Activate when the task requires this repo's code, rules, workflows,
  known gotchas, or validation commands.
```

Guidelines:
- **Enough length** — aim for ≥ 20 English-style words or ≥ 40 CJK characters; short descriptions fail to activate reliably
- **Use the user's actual language(s)** — if users ask in Chinese, include Chinese quoted phrases alongside English; do not rely on translation / semantic similarity alone
- **Include quoted trigger phrases** — exact phrases the user would say for the skill's domain / intent cluster
- **Third-person format** — "This skill should be used when…" not "I help with…"
- **Include activation conditions** — describe the context, not just the action
- **Do not enumerate workflows** — `fix-bug`, `release`, `maintain-docs`, etc. belong in Common Tasks unless they identify a separate domain skill

Run `scripts/check-description-routing.sh` after changing frontmatter; it catches obvious over-broad descriptions, workflow keyword stuffing, and duplicate trigger phrases across multiple skills.

The template above uses a two-tier structure:

- **Always Read** (2–3 core files, ~150 lines total) — read every time; in the full scaffold this list is generated from `routing.yaml`
- **Common Tasks** (task-routed) — Agent reads ONLY the files listed for the current task; in the full scaffold these rows are generated from `routing.yaml`; always include a fallback entry for unlisted tasks

**Keep routing in sync:** When you create or rename an always-read, workflow, or reference file, add or update `routing.yaml`, then run `scripts/sync-routing.sh`. The `update-rules.md` workflow includes this as a checklist item.

**Common Tasks sizing:** Keep entries to 8–10 tasks maximum. Beyond that, agents waste tokens scanning unrelated entries. If you have more than 10 recurring task types, group related tasks under domain headings (e.g., `### Backend Tasks`, `### Frontend Tasks`) or merge low-frequency tasks into the "Other" fallback.

**"Other / unlisted task" matching:** The fallback entry should tell agents how to find the right workflow without reading every file. Workflow files use a verb-noun naming convention (`add-page.md`, `fix-bug.md`, `release.md`) — agents can match by filename alone. If that's not sufficient, add a one-line directory listing in the fallback entry: `Available workflows: add-controller, add-entity, fix-bug, release`.

This keeps per-task reading to the minimum set needed, rather than loading all rules for every task.

## Relation to Official Skill Template / Spec

Anthropic's public [`skills` repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) defines the **minimal** skill shape: a folder with a `SKILL.md`, plus frontmatter where `name` identifies the skill and `description` explains what it does and when to use it.

This meta-skill does **not** replace that minimum. It starts one level later:

- Use the official-style minimal single `SKILL.md` when the skill is still small, self-contained, and not scattered across multiple entry files.
- Upgrade to `skills/<name>/` with `rules/`, `workflows/`, and `references/` only when the skill starts to sprawl: long files, duplicated entries, or recurring knowledge that needs active maintenance.

Rule of thumb:

- Official template answers: "How do I create a valid skill?"
- `skill-based-architecture` answers: "How do I keep a growing project skill precise, navigable, and maintainable?"

Do not copy the full official spec into project docs. Link to the canonical source when helpful, and keep local docs focused on project structure and task routing.

## Positioning in the Agent Stack

Where this skill sits, and what it does **not** cover. Read this when an agent feels unstable and you need to decide whether the fix belongs here, in prompt phrasing, or in a different harness layer.

### Three layers of agent reliability

Agent reliability lives on three layers. This skill is **not** a silver bullet — it acts on the second and a slice of the third.

| Layer | Question it answers | What this skill provides |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt Engineering** | How do I phrase the task so the model understands? | Indirect — via the `description` frontmatter as a trigger condition, and via the writing style guidance for rules / workflows |
| **Context Engineering** | How do I deliver the right information to the model? | **Primary focus** — two-layer routing (Always Read + Common Tasks), thin shells with inline routing, registration entry, progressive disclosure |
| **Harness Engineering** | How does the surrounding system keep execution stable when the model alone is not enough? | **Partial** — Session Discipline + Rationalizations Table + SessionStart hook = a minimal harness for *context re-injection across long sessions* |

### The Four-Primitive Audit

When an agent feels unstable, the root cause is rarely the model. Ask these four questions before blaming the prompt:

1. **State** — Is there an explicit marker of what step we are on, or does the agent re-derive it each turn?
2. **Validation** — Is there a check at each critical node, or do we only verify at the end?
3. **Orchestration** — Is there a task plan with checkpoints, or does every failure restart from step 1?
4. **Recovery** — Is there a resume path after a failed step, or does the agent always re-run everything?

Three "no"s = this is a harness problem, not a model problem. Re-tuning the prompt will not help.

### What this skill does **not** cover

Treat these as orthogonal concerns — do **not** extend this meta-skill's templates beyond the narrow migration scaffolding already provided:

- **Tool-execution stability** (browser clicks that silently no-op, API calls that return half-complete responses, page DOM changing under the agent). Use a verification-focused skill (e.g. superpowers' `verification-before-completion`) or a dedicated tool-agent harness.
- **General long-chain checkpoint / resume.** Migration is one-shot — if a phase crashes, the documented path is "wipe the partial scaffold and rerun" rather than a state machine. Broader application workflows that genuinely need pause/resume need project-specific state, validation, and recovery inside that project's own `rules/` or `workflows/`.
- **Multi-agent orchestration.** See superpowers' `subagent-driven-development` or equivalent. This skill only routes *within one agent's session*.

Adding state / validation / recovery primitives beyond the migration scaffold is that downstream project's own engineering work — it belongs in the project's `rules/` or `workflows/`, not in this meta-skill.
